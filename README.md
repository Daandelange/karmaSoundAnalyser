Details
=======

It uses lib Aubio for onset and tempo detection.
Iâ€™ve had difficulties compiling the Pd plugin and I got it working using Pd-Extended compiled in 64 bit with Aubio 0.3.3 also in 64 bit.
Other features include an alternative onSet detection, pitch detection, silence detection and a 5-band equaliser.
